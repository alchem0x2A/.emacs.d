My .emacs.d configurations
* Overview
** Editor UI design
- Use =moe-theme= for the color scheme
** Mac-specified features to mimic a "modern" editor
See the section below


* Global Mac-specific features
Maximize the use of âŒ˜ (super) key in Emacs according to personal behavior.
** Window navigation 
- =s-w=: delete current window (no kill buffer). Equivalent to =C-x 0=
- =s-<left>=: Move to the beginning of line
- =s-<right>=: Move to the end of line
- =s-<up>=: Move to beginning of buffer. Equivalent to =<home>= (Fn + Left on Mac keyboard)
- =s-<down>=: Move to end of buffer. Equivalent to =<end>= (Fn + Right on Mac keyboard)
- =M-s-<up>=: Move to upper window
- =M-s-<down>=: Move to lower window
- =M-s-<left>=: Move to left window
- =M-s-<right>=: Move to right window

** Undo / redo

The original undo/ redo functionalities of Emacs are fancy but also
complicated when implementing redo. We use =undo-tree= mode to manage
all the undo / redo history in Emacs. 

The following key bindings are used by convention:
- =s-z=: undo using =undo-tree-undo=
- =s-Z=: redo using =undo-tree-red=

Note in the =undo-tree= mode, the key =C-x u= is binded to visualize
the undo tree. I personally don't prefer this approach and set =C-x u=
to the usual =undo= binding defined by Emacs.

** Delete behavior
The default behavior of "kill" in emacs is a fancy feature but not so
appealing to users like me (coming from background of Sublime, XCode
etc.)  The annoying part of the default behavior comes for the
following scenario:
1. Copy some text from another buffer to the kill-ring
2. Go to the buffer that you want to edit, delete the regions with
   keys like =C-<backspace>=, =s-<backspace>= etc.
3. Now the last kill-ring becomes the text you deleted (killed) during
   step 2, and you have to go explicitly to the kill-ring to find out
   what needs to be pasted

This default behavior is avoided by explicitly invoking the delete
functions (see =settings/editor.el= for details). In brief, the following key-bindings will not save the deleted region to kill-ring:
- =s-<backspace>=: delete all contents of the line before the
  position. Will not greedily delete when invoking multiple times.
*************** TODO Maybe change to consecutive delete
*************** END
- =s-<kp-delete>=: delete all contents of the line after the
  position. No greedy deletion.
- =C-<backspace>=, =M-<backspace>=: backward delete a word or
  subword. When =syntax-subword-mode= is present, use the
  =syntax-subword-forward= method to locate subword; otherwise the
  normal =subword-forward=.
- =C-<kp-delete>=, =M-<kp-delete>=: backward delete a word or subword.
** Select and comment
Use convention from other text editors. 
- =s-l=: select current line
- =s-/=: comment current line / region, enabled with Emacs version
\gt{}25.0

The usual key-binding =M-;= (=comment-dwim=) is used when you want to
append some comment at the end of a line.
